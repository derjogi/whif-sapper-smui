<h1>About WHIF</h1>

<p><br/>The idea for WHIF was born as an accumulation of various situations where I wondered about "<b>w</b>hat
	<b>h</b>appens <b>if</b> we do this or that...".

	<br/><br/>For example, before 'Basic Income' became a hype I asked myself (and in fact was
	discussing about it with my brother and a Friend on our way to a rock concert)
	<br/>what would happen if we'd raise the tax rate and fix it at e.g. 50% (no matter what) and therefor give every citizen (no matter what) $1000 / month.<br/>Or
	whatever amount might be necessary to satisfy basic human needs.
	<br/><br/>We managed to figure out that it would
	solve all our problems - but of course we were also aware that we're all pretty biased and don't have all the
	information.
	<br/><br/>So how could we get that? Ask the crowd of course.
	<br/><br/>Stackoverflow, Reddit, Facebook,
	... we could have gone there and asked around.
	<br/>But none of us felt that any of those sites were suitable to
	discuss a topic such as this, simply because it would be an enourmous and very annoying task to keep track of all
	the good answers, not having to read through repetitive ones, distilling a 'summary' out of it...<br/><br/>And
	that's finally where I decided, I should create just that: A platform where this annoying task is avoided by having
	a summary straight from the beginning,<br/>where one doesn't need to look through every reply, where the community
	keeps the summary up-to-date and the opinion of everyone contributing still stays around and can be found reasonably
	easy.<br/><br/>This all was a few years ago, and since then not only have countless other 'WHIF' (What happens
	if...) questions popped up, but also the idea has gained on volume - significantly.<br/><br/>Because getting the
	right information is only the first step.<br/><br/>We also want to use that information for some sort of decision
	making.<br/>And that decision making should be collective.<br/>And powerful.<br/><br/>... so we also need some sort
	of 'solution proposals', voting, a reward system (tokens), verification, controlls, controller-controlls, metrics,
	... the full suite.<br/>WHIF will be the mere beginning of a gigantic undertaking to get us there.<br/><br/>If this
	all sparked your interest you'll probably have many more questions, that short bit above really didn't make all that
	much sense.<br/>But fear not, there is <a href="drive.google.com/whathappensif">material online</a>. And I am super
	willing to chat with anyone who contacts me, so please, get in touch.<br/><br/>Cheers, and onto a bright future. Or
	something like that.
